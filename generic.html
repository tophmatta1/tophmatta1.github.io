	<h3>YOU ARE PROBABLY WONDERING...WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT?</h3>
	<p>Well, for starters, my name is pronounced "Toe' + f" and it's short for Christopher. My lovely friends starting calling me that back in freshman year of highschool and it just kind of stuck. You see, they would call me up on "Ye Old Landline" asking for Chris at which point my Mom would finish the rest of the name for them like so (because everyone in my family did and still calls me Christopher):
		<ul>Awkward Friend: Hello! er, um is Chris there?</ul>
		<ul>Sweet Mom: Hi yes one second, I'll get Chris<b>TOPHER</b>... Chris<b>TOPHER</b> [in the sweetest way possible]</ul>
	</p>

	<p>So that naturally led to being called Topher then finally shortened to Toph. Some people kept trying to keep going by shortening it to 'T', <i>but</i>...actually that never happened.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>OK OK, I GET IT, BUT WHAT CAN TOPH DO FOR ME?</h4>
	<p>I'm not straight out of college, so I have great soft skills and know how to work with all types of people to get the job done. Not just done, but done well. Really well (AKA I am highly detail-oriented).</p>
	<p>I know I don't know everything and I will be the first to tell you. One of things that gets me out of bed in the morning is the fact that I will probably learn something new in one way or another. No need in pretending I know everything because that's nearly impossible in any field. What's important is the ability to pick up and learn new topics on-the-go and apply them right away with relentless effort. </p>

	<p>I have a wide-ranging background and wholeheartedly agree that specialization is the killer of creativity. Having many different angles to attack a problem with, which stems from learning many different things, allows for the best outcomes to be achieved. Furthermore, I believe that in order to produce a great product, you have to start with the user and back up from there, considering what is of most importance to them. Not necessarily giving them what they want, but what they don't yet know they need.</p>
