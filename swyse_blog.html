	<h3>What problem needs to be solved?</h3>

	<p>
		Think about this: You've been doing some research online and you've decided you want to try your hand at building some rustic, industrial-looking furniture. You focus on getting all of the materials and realize you don't have any of the tools. What are your next steps? In the society we live in today, if we need a tool or object to any type of task and we don't have it, we are left with the following options: buy it new, buy it used, or borrow it from a friend.  Now this is a crazy thought: what if there was a 4th option - leasing an item from someone you <i>don't</i> know? By conducting contextual inquiry on this idea, we found that an overwhelming majority of people wished there was the option of leasing items for a short amount of time. The next step was to see how far other companies have gone to deliver this service. Via competitive analysis, it was discovered that none of the businesses existing had any type of edge that would corner the market. The best option resembled a slightly jazzed up craigslist. Thus, <em>swyse</em> ('SW-EYE-SS') is born.

	<h3>What is the core experience we want to deliver to the user?</h3>
	<p>
		Essentially, how could we build a marketplace that would allow for people with extra goods sitting around to mingle with the people who just want to use it momentarily? And how do we delight both the lender and the lessee to the point where they can't wait to use the service again and end up telling all of their family and friends about it?
	</p>
	<p>
		First, we have to define who the user is and pinpoint the specific market that has already wished there was something like this that exists. So who are they? Not, who are the type of people who would use this service, in general. Who would be our early adopters - our feedback control loops and 1000 true fans? The following qualities are what we targeted in our users:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Eco-conscious</li>
	  <li>18-30 yrs. old</li>
	  <li>Tech savvy</li>
	  <li>Has used one or more of the following: Uber, Lyft, Airbnb
	</ul>

	<p>
		Now that we know who our users are, how do we make sure that they will love to use our service and can't wait to come back for more? We ensure that we keep the experience as simple and pleasing to the eye as possible. We do that by focusing on visual and UI/UX design of the product, bringing it to the users,  and getting their feedback. We conduct A/B testing, more contextual inquiry, and user-story mapping to amass data. We then interpret that data, drive decisions based on it, and mold it into something we believe they want, continuously iterating until we know that's what they want.

	<h3>What lessons were learned?</h3>
	<p>
		With current sharing economy companies, such as Uber and Airbnb, swyse seemed like a no-brainer next step, but for possessions therefore one of the critical questions we felt was important to answer at beginning stages was, "Why isn't there a solution on the same scale as these companies?". Thus, we employed a SWOT analysis to identify the internal/external strengths and weaknesses of the product, so we could identify areas where the product would outperform competition and also where short and long term potential problems would lie.
