	<h3>What problem needs to be solved?</h3>
	<p> I was frustrated that there was no alternative to either buying something new or used and having to keep it for the forseeable future until you either sold or donated it. Why not pay money in order to be able to access someone else's lawnmower for a couple hours instead of having to buy one or pay for expensive lawn service?

	<p>What makes a successful product? When I think of apps or products that are outstanding, some that come to mind are AirBNB, iPhone, and Instagram. Pretending I have no knowledge of anything that goes into creating a piece of software or product such as these, what I believe makes them enjoyable to use is largely due to the aesthetics (design) and flow (UI/UX) of the app. Not to say it isn't important as it's arguably the most important, the engineering aspect is only noticeable when things aren't working properly. This design-driven course of action is the direction I intended to take with swyse.</p>
